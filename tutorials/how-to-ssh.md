# How to ssh to your server?

Once you recieve the access to the server from IT (i.e. a username is created for you in the server) and you get the *username* and *password*. 

Then go to your command line (terminal) and type
```sh
ssh username@ip-address
```

Note: If you are on Windows, it is recommended to have WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) installed as it makes your life easier and gives you a linux terminal to work with. The above command works even with a pre-installed windows command-line also. So don't worry if you dont have WSL installed.
